      Research Part 1: Preparing food Making food for oneself in College isn’t
      as difficult as it seems. There are many ways to make your own food
      healthy, quick, and cheap without having to waste money on a dining plan.
      Most of them can also be done in less than 30 minutes!
    </p>

    <p>
      The golden pantry staples: salt, pepper, cooking oil, spices, and red (or
      white) vinegar. These common items can add the final pizzaz to a multitude
      of meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Top meals (w/o stove) Cereal- The easiest way to eat breakfast without
      spending 8$ a day. Be careful, many cereals are sweets in disguise!
    </p>
    <p>
      The most widely available, healthy, and most delicious cereals are the
      original “Kellogg's corn flakes”, “Cheerios”, and “Fiber One” cereals.
      They have low sugar, high fiber, high protein, and organic ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rice- Rice is an incredible source of food that has been a large part of
      my diet growing up! Brown rice is high in starch, antioxidants, nutrients,
      and fiber while white rice should be combined with vegetables and lentils
      to make a hearty meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandwiches and more!- These light brown squares of delight can become a
      super food with ingredients such as lettuce, tomato, onion, spinach,
      pickles, avocado, cheese, and more! There are many combinations that are
      delicious, healthy, and unique that I will scour the internet to find. I
      continue exploring and researching the best salads, sandwiches, and other
      meals.
    </p>

      Research Question: How can one stay healthy and productive in College?
    </p>
    <p>
      Research part 2: Nutrition Nutrition: College students around the ages of
      18 usually need 2200 calories (for women) and 2500- 3000 calories (for
      men) every day. A person’s calorie necessities largely depend on the
      person’s age, build, activity level, and other variables, so the “average”
      calorie intake should be verified by a nutritionist or doctor if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 3 musketeers of nutrients: Proteins, Carbohydrates, and Fat Carbs and
      Fat shouldn’t be avoided at all, in fact half of one’s calories comes from
      Carbs alone! There are good and bad sources of fat and carbohydrates, and
      this misconception that all of them should be avoided is very harmful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 3 main types of carbs are sugars, fibers, and starches and these can
      either be complex or simple. Usually complex carbs are considered
      “healthier” because they usually take longer to break down as well as
      having more important nutrients for the body. Fats also have a
      misconception, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are usually
      healthy while saturated fats are unhealthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remaining questions: What is my personal diet, nutrition, and activity
      recommended by expert nutritionists? What are the remaining meals
      (sandwiches, salads, etc.) and how healthy are they? What resources are
      available to use when I can’t access the “healthy” foods one day? How
      should my diet change when I am working out?
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Research part  3: Adapting to College & self-improvement College is a time
      in one’s life when they gain an incredible amount of freedom, the best way
      to use that freedom is to improve oneself! I will research the information
      most needed when becoming a new college student and how to adapt to this
      new environment. I will be trying to explore subjects such as office 365
      (excel, word, etc.), general computer knowledge, banking & finances,
      exercise, coding (HTML, CSS, Java), and more! These basic tools are used
      so much in college and are very useful too master because of the time they
      can save!

      the Kitchen Cool.” Taste of Home, RDA Enthusiast Brands LLC, 21 May 2021,
      https://www.tasteofhome.com/collection/fresh-balanced-filling-no-cook-summer-dinners/.
      The author, Molly Jasinski describes a multitude of easy recipes that do
      not require cooking. The article provided me with useful recipes that I
      used as a reference/inspiration to design other simple recipes. It allowed
      me to see the variety possible with simple salads and sandwiches and
      showed me that “cooking” is not limited to any one ingredient and instead
      is a very open and creative process. Olshansky Clara. “Every Cereal Brand

      Olshansky provided a wealth of information about the healthiest and
      unhealthiest cereals to eat. It allowed me to identify the healthiest
      cereals to eat by providing the cereal's sugar, fiber, and protein
      quantities. I was able to identify the cereals I recognized the most and
      use that information in my project in order to see the most widely
      available, healthy cereals for breakfast Scheinberg, Dianne. “Healthy Diet
      for Adolescents (Ages 12-18).” Winchester Hospital, Beth Israel Lahey
      Health, 1 Sept. 2017,
      https://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=214376.
      Dianne Scheinberg's article about a "healthy diet for adolescents" was the
      most helpful resource because of the vast amount of information it
      provided. I was able to see information such as calorie intake, key
      nutrients such as fats, carbs, and protein, vitamins, minerals, and more.
      I identified these broad topics and did more research on the topics such
      as "key nutrients" in my project.
