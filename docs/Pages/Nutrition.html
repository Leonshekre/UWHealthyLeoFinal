    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="normal_text1">A Balanced Diet</h2>
    <p class="normal_text1">
      The chart shown on the left is a great start to a nutritious life, however... <br>
      This chart isnt a definitve guide to perfect health, people are vastly different, so this guide should be followed loosely. <br> Taking it slow is the first step to success!
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Nutrition </h2>
    <p>College students around the ages of 18 usually need 2200 calories (for women) and 2500- 3000 calories (for men) every day. A person’s calorie necessities largely depend on the person’s age, build, activity level, and other variables, so the “average” calorie intake should be verified by a nutritionist or doctor if possible.</p>
    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">The 3 musketeers of nutrients:
      Proteins, Carbohydrates, and Fat</h3>
    <p>
      Carbs and Fat shouldn’t be avoided at all, in fact half of one’s calories comes from Carbs alone! There are good and bad sources of fat and carbohydrates, and this misconception that all of them should be avoided is very harmful.
      </p>
    <p>The 3 main types of carbs are sugars, fibers, and starches and these can either be complex or simple. Usually complex carbs are considered “healthier” because they usually take longer to break down as well as having more important nutrients for the body. 
    Fats also have a misconception, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are usually healthy while saturated fats are unhealthy. </p>


    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Vitamins and Minerals</h3>
    <p>A critical part of one's diet that many neglect</p>
    <p>The 3 main vitamins are A,D, and E. <br>These vitamnis help with eyesight and the immune system; calcium usage; and the immune system respectively</p>
    <p>The main minerals include: Calcium, Folate, Iron, Zinc, and Magnesium</p>
    <p>Calcium: bone strength|Folate + zinc: growth|Iron: red blood cell production|Magnesium: heart health and bone strength</p>

    <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Sugar</h3>
    <p>According to the Association for Health Alternatives Males should consume no more than 36 grams of sugar while women should consumer less than 24 grams of sugar... yet</p>
    <p>The average sugar intake for people in the United States is an astonishing...</p>
    <h4>71 grams of sugar</h4>
    <p>That is double what is necessary to be healthy!</p>
    <!-- AHHHHHHHHH-->
    <h2 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">Nutrition of recipes!</h3>
    <!-- Rice -->
    <h2>Nutrients in...</h2>
    
    <h3>Rice!</h3>
  
    <p>Rice is an incredible food source that can be filling and healthy if mixed with the right ingredients</p>
    <p>Brown rice and White rice are both abundant in carbs and calories, but brown rice has "good carbs"... yes those exist! White rice undergoes a process that strips it of its fibers, vitamins, and minerals so it isn't as nutritious as brown rice, although it is still an option if paired with the right ingredients</p>
    Brown rice is very nutrient rich, it contains: 
    <div style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration: underline; " title="Helps with blood sugar, gut health, and heart health!">Fiber</div>
    <div style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration: underline;"title="Helps with mental health, eye health, aging, and aging!">Antioxidants</div> 
    <div style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration: underline;"title="Taking vitamins helps with many different factors such as aging, anxiety, stress, the immune system, eyesight, and bone strength!">Vitamins</div> 
    <div style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration: underline;"title="Minerals help build strong bones and turn food into energy!">Minerals</div>  
    <p>Hint: Hover over these words!</p>
    <!-- TRY TO MAKE VOCAB WHERE YOU HOVER AND IT SHOWS DEF -->

    <h3>Salads</h3>
    <p></p>
    <!-- Cereal -->
    <h3>Cereals</h3>
    <p>The easiest way to eat breakfast without spending 8$ a day. Be careful, many cereals are sweets in disguise! <br><br>The most widely available, healthy, and most delicious cereals are the original  “Kellogg's corn flakes”, “Cheerios”, and “Fiber One” cereals. They have low sugar, high fiber, high protein, and organic ingredients.
